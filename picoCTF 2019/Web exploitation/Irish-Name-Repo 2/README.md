## Question
There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/14912/ (link). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:14912

## Solution
The hint said the password field is filtered so we probably have to start from the username. Using `admin'--` as the username, we can login succesfully. We guessed that the login portal only make use of one query similar to `select username, password from users where username='admin'--'and password=''`.
