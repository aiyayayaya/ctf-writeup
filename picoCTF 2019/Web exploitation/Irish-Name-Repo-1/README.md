## Question
There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32241/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32241. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Solution
Judging from the hints, the website is using a SQL database for it so it might be vulnerable to SQL injection.

In the login page, I tried the most generic injection "' OR '1'='1" in the password field and filled in admin as the username (this field does not matter, turned out). Then I logged in and got the flag.
