# logon


## Question
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32270/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32270

Enter Inspector mode. Select the Application tab, then expand the cookies to see the values.
