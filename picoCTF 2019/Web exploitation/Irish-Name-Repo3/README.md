## Question
There is a secure website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21874/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21874. Try to see if you can login as admin!

## Solution
This time, the hint said the password is encrypted. Lets look at the html source first.

`<input type="hidden" name="debug" value="0">` this was seen in the source code. Lets change the value to 1 and login.

Using password "asd", we got `SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = 'nfq'` as a response. Looks like the encryption is a Caesar Cipher. 

Lets try to double check:
```
password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = 'nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm'
```

So it is Caesar Cipher without doubt and it is ROT13. Lets try to encode `' or 1=1--` in ROT13 and inject.

Typing `' be 1=1--`, we get the flag.

Flag: `picoCTF{3v3n_m0r3_SQL_d78e3333}`
