# what's a net cat


## Question 
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to 2019shell1.picoctf.com at port 12265 to get the flag?

## Solution
```console
foo@bar:~$ nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 12265
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_74df27a3}
```
flag: `picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_74df27a3}`
